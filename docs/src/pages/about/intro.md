# About Me

I am an American computer scientist, and CEO of <a href="https://bear.ai/" target="_blank">Bear AI</a>, where I work on applied machine learning for risk assessment and wealth management. I'm currently the CTO of <a href="https://venturedojo.com/" target="_blank">Venture Dojo</a>, which I also co-founded.

## Bio

I lived in Miami.

I moved to Berkeley, California.

I read a lot of books and I'm always open to recommendations.

I write [code]() and [idiotic comments]() about the things I see.

I sometimes write [longer idiotic comments](), too.

I was an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="https://cs61a.org/" target="_blank">CS 61A</a>.

I am passionate about Machine Intelligence and General AI; more specifically: deep learning, statistical machine learning, computer vision, robotics, algorithms, reinforcement learning, time series (recurrent neural networks), generative models, and computer graphics. I like problems, challenges, and hard questions.

On a daily basis, I work on complex projects, and while I enjoy experimenting with new research, I understand the importance of placing focus on the end goal: delivering a beautiful, functional product or service to the user/client.

I see every new experience as an opportunity to learn. My favorite projects are those that require me to push beyond my boundaries and acquire new skills and knowledge in order to succeed.

When I'm not behind a computer screen, I'm out there somewhere exploring.

Pilot, skier, rescue scuba diver, and foodie at heart.

## Research

My research draws on topics and methods from Machine Learning, Computational Linguistics (Natural Language Processing) and Quantum Information Theory (specifically the use of category theoretical frameworks). My main project presently involves developing software for analyzing and understanding high-dimensional data from financial securities and the blockchain. I am generally interested in theories of - and applications for - computer science, neuroscience, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.
